'''gist.py

A command-line gist poster in Python.

This project is mainly a demo of docopt and cmd, two great python libraries for
making beautiful and functional command-line programs. This utility can be used
as a quick way to post gists from the command line, or if the user does not
provide a filename then a command prompt is opened.

Usage: gist.py [-d <desc>] [<filename>]

Options:
    -d <desc>   A short description of this gist [default: ]
    <filename>  A file to be posted as a gist.'''
